                        You know boy....
                        Whenever I think of you I start smiling 
                        Even if someone says your name I start blushing 😊 
                        Whenever I m with you I forget about this whole world 
                        Whenever I see your eyes I feel there no need to see stars anymore 
                        Cuz your eyes show me all the stars 
                        Whenever I hear your voice I feel there is no need to listen to music anymore 
                        Cuz your voice becomes the sweetest music for my ears
                        Whenever I see you I feel there no one as sweet and handsome as you
                        Ya boyyyyy I am deeply in love withhhhhh youuuuuuu❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
